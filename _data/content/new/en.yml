Adept at leading cross-functional teams in agile environments, leveraging microservices architecture, REST APIs, and gRPC to deliver real-time solutions, as demonstrated in the US Air Force MEDUSA system and DoD's MARS AI-assisted database. Proven technical leader with a track record of mentoring engineers, optimizing system performance, and driving innovation in fast-paced, hyper-growth settings.

    ## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

    **Self Employed MLOps Researcher & Consultant (2/2023 – Present)**
    - Design and operate a 5 node K3s homelab that prototypes enterprise MLOps patterns (centralized scheduler, scoped operator, A/B testing).
    - Open sourced k3s homelab, ml platform, and financial mlops pytorch repositories, demonstrating automated pipelines with MLflow, Argo Workflows, Seldon Core v2, and Harbor.
    - Contributed bug fix & feature PR #6582 to Seldon Core v2, improving model scheduling resiliency across namespaces.
    - Published 15+ Medium articles and launched personal tech site jtayl222.github.io to document best practices.

    **Principal Software Engineer, Leidos (1/2023 – 1/2025)**
    - Enhanced the MEDUSA command-and-control system, a Java-based microservices architecture built with Spring Boot and gRPC, enabling real-time data processing and integrating sensor data with actionable user interfaces for U.S. Air Force drone threat mitigation.
    - Collaborated on replacing a JavaFX GUI with a REST API built on TypeScript and Node.js, supporting the evolution of a real-time command-and-control system.
    - Architected and optimized Gradle-based build scripts and Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, leveraging Docker on AWS to ensure resilient, scalable deployments in an air-gapped environment; reduced build failures by refining automation scripts.
    - Implemented infrastructure as code and automated tasks with Bash and Python scripts, streamlining log analysis and improving operational efficiency for a distributed, high-availability system.
    - Research machine learning capabilities, developing a Bayesian network classification system for RADAR signal data, enhancing threat identification accuracy.
    - Mentored team members in test-driven development and DevOps best practices within an Agile (SAFe) framework, fostering iterative delivery and elevating code quality through peer reviews.
    - To enable communication with sensors and emitters, used JAXB to marshal Java objects into XML and unmarshal XML into Java objects.
    - Used tools including OpenTelemetry, PostgreSQL, SQLite, JPA and SQL instrument and monitor the application.

    **Senior Consultant, Red Hat's Intelligent Application Practice (8/2018 – 1/2023)**
    - Delivered expert-level DevOps and application development solutions as an embedded consultant at customer sites (e.g., Peraton, Citibank, Verizon), with a focus on Java-based microservices and Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes clusters in 100% Linux environments.
    - Developed and deployed an AI-assisted expert system for the MARS project (DoD) at Peraton using Java and DRL rules, enhancing data ingestion and transaction analysis within a secure, cloud-native architecture.
    - Designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using Git, Maven, and OpenShift, automating scalable microservice deployments and crafting Kubernetes YAML configurations for mission-critical applications.
    - Created Python and bash scripts to streamline workflows, analyze logs, and optimize system performance, improving operational efficiency across distributed systems.
    - Acted as onsite OpenShift technical lead, troubleshooting cluster issues, advising on system design, and mentoring teams of up to four engineers on automation best practices within agile frameworks.
    - Leveraged Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Decision Manager to build robust expert systems, ensuring high reliability and customer satisfaction for DoD, banking, and telecom clients.
