        # A/B Testing in Production MLOps: Why Traditional Deployments Fail ML Models

        **‚ö° Production MLOps Implementation - Part 1 of 2**

        A comprehensive exploration of why traditional software deployment strategies fall short for ML models, demonstrated through a real-world fraud detection system built with Seldon Core v2 Pattern 3 architecture.

        ## üéØ Key Technical Challenges
        - **Performance vs Business Impact Disconnect** - Better ML metrics don't always mean better business outcomes
        - **Model Behavior Changes in Production** - Data drift, concept drift, and infrastructure differences
        - **Risk Management Requirements** - Regulatory compliance, business continuity, and real-time constraints
        - **Preprocessing Pipeline Validation** - Critical infrastructure issues that can cause complete model failure

        ## üèóÔ∏è Real-World Implementation
        - **Kubernetes + Seldon Core v2** - Official Pattern 3 architecture for production deployments
        - **80/20 Traffic Splitting** - Conservative approach for financial risk models
        - **Comprehensive Metrics Collection** - Model performance, system performance, and business impact
        - **Automated Decision Framework** - Data-driven deployment decisions with fallback mechanisms

        ## üìä Production Results
        - **Baseline Model**: 73.5% recall, 97.9% precision
        - **Candidate Model**: 100% recall, 95.9% precision (with optimal thresholds)
        - **Critical Discovery**: Models predicted 0.0 for all transactions due to preprocessing issues
        - **Validation Success**: A/B testing safely identified and resolved infrastructure problems

        ## üö® Mission-Critical Lessons
        - **Offline metrics don't guarantee production success** - 100% recall became 0% due to feature pipeline issues
        - **A/B testing validates complete production pipelines** - Discovers infrastructure failures with limited exposure
        - **Conservative traffic splits limit business risk** - 80/20 allocation provides statistical power safely
        - **Automated decision frameworks prevent disasters** - Real-time performance monitoring with automatic fallback

        This technical implementation demonstrates the gap between ML theory and production reality, providing practical solutions for safely deploying fraud detection models at scale.

        ## üö® Critical Infrastructure Discoveries
        - **Feature Ordering Mismatch** - Training vs production API feature sequence differences
        - **Missing Feature Scaling** - StandardScaler parameters not applied in production
        - **Sub-optimal Thresholds** - Default 0.5 vs optimal 0.9 threshold for candidate model
        - **Model Naming Issues** - MLServer internal names vs Seldon resource names confusion

        ## üß™ Production Validation Pipeline
        ```python
        # Production Pipeline Validation Tool
        class FraudDetectionPipeline:
            def preprocess_transaction(self, transaction_data):
                # CRITICAL: Match training preprocessing exactly
                # 1. Same feature ordering as training
                # 2. Same StandardScaler parameters 
                # 3. Same data types and shapes
        ```

        ## üìà Online Validation Results
        **Baseline (v1)**: 95.65% precision, 73.33% recall
        **Candidate (v2)**: 96.77% precision, 100.0% recall
        **Improvement**: +36.4% recall, +1.12% precision (exceeded expectations!)

        ## üõ†Ô∏è Production Infrastructure
